give tags to words, so that monster has tags, too.

Skills can target tags, so some skill will be especially useful when dealing with monster with specific tags.

Tags can be contributed by the mass and reviewed by them.

Equpiment has durability, if it's used up, you must redo the test to recover it.(the forget/learning curve)

Maybe some chanted should be typed during the fight(don't know if it's a good idea)

Different rules for generate item and monster in different language, like `adj+adj+noun` or `noun+adj+adj`

Or maybe different language just allows different basic properties.

So a word has its name, its meanings, its pronouncation, its basic type, which language it belongs to, its tags,its relations with other words, its gameing attribute(rarity, skills,

Later when this game is hot, to achive a good weapon requires online-review from other players.

Allow online-mode and local-mode.

Allow cross-language battle, it should be a option for player to choose.

Allow people to make monsters online.

Then we need apis for people to upload all kinds of records to data-base.

We need a talbe named word to record all words.

Another called skills to record all skills, we need a formula/skill language to describe skills.

Everyone can have some equipment, but we have another system to describe the mastery of that equipment(by peers)

Fighting scripts can be a collabarative work.

We need also define game attributes:
* hp
* attack, defence
* speed(attacking rate)
* stamina(will weaken yourself when it is not sufficient.)
* fatigue(need time to recover)
* add 2d range系统
* add 3d 距离系统

Skills:

* dodge
* critical attack
* true damage
* revive
* reflect damage
* life steal
* Transformation: transform into another status
* Increase/decrease all attributes for myself/enemy
* Immune damage for a while
* Reflect damage
* Detect special status(both player) and do corresponding action(like hp ratio, attack, defence, dodge, etc.)
* dotted damage and clearance
* Stun
